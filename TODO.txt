TODO
Some clocks (e.g., Bally) are 1 second behind. It's probably not noticeable,
but we should consider fixing them.

TODO
Change Archy's animation to an expanding/collapsing arch.

TODO
Touch and drag time manually in Archy, Vertie, maybe Bubbly.

TODO
Quiz "accomplishments!" (i.e., tie quizzes into Google API)

TODO
Other quizzes:
- Set the clock
  The easiest could be (in both items above) letting the computer choose
  a random time.
- Symmetries
  Some more mathematical questions could be about symmetries (going back
  or forward from time 00:00).
  This works for the minutes but not for the hour (11:58 is on any
  analog clock not symmetric to 00:02) because the hour are basically a
  floor function...
  More precisely it works for the smallest unity you are considering..
  Maybe it is too complicated? Or indeed interesting?
- Multiples
  Questions
  How do the multiples of 20 look like for the minutes?
  How do the multiples of 12 look like for the minutes?
  How do the multiples of 15 look like for the minutes?
  Answers
  The 4-remainder and the 5-remainder are zero.
  The 3-remainder and the 4-remainder are zero.
  The 3-remainder and the 5-remainder are zero.
- Shifts
  Question
  What happens by increasing/decreasing the time by 20 minutes?
  What happens by increasing/decreasing the time by 12 minutes?
  What happens by increasing/decreasing the time by 15 minutes?
  Only the 3-remainder changes. The 4-remainder and 5-remainder stay the same.
  Only the 5-remainder changes. The 3-remainder and 4-remainder stay the same.
  Only the 4-remainder changes. The 3-remainder and 5-remainder stay the same
- Alignments
  For Bally=Ringy (picture needed, or simply a link): For which times
  are the balls vertically aligned?
  The minute must be 0 or 30, and the same holds for the second. The
  hour must be 0 (or 12, in the 24-hour clock).
- Equalities
  Suppose that the 4-remainder and the 5-remainder of the minute are
  both equal to some integer N which is either 0,1,2,3. What can the
  minute be?
  N, 20+N, or 40+N
  Suppose that the 3-remainder and the 4-remainder of the minute are
  both equal to some integer N which is either 0,1,2. What can the
  minute be?
  N, 12+N, 24+N, 36+N, or 48+N
  Suppose that the 3-remainder and the 5-remainder of the minute are
  both equal to some integer N which is either 0,1,2. What can the
  minute be?
  N, 15+N, 30+N or 45+N

DONE
- Fade in/out of Polly (6ish June 2017).
- First implementation of Archy (6ish June 2017).
- First implementation of Bubbly (13 June 2017).
- Split Polly into three different designs:
  a) Linus simply moves lines about a polygon.
  b) Shady fills a polygon without using lines.
  c) Vertie rotates a highlight around the vertices, much as Ballsy rotates a ball around a circle.
- Move strings to string file(s), to assist with eventual internationalization.
  (This may not be entirely done, but I'm cleaning it up wherever I find it.)
- Add an honest settings panel and clean up the interface.
- Add a toggle to hide the seconds.
- Add a toggle to hide the time.
- Implement toggle to hide the time.
- Add toggle button to reverse order of seconds, minutes, and hours.
- The settings panel will crash if we reorient the phone while the settings are open.
  Android docs have some information on this; fix!
- Implement reversal of order of units.
- Implement hiding of seconds representation.
- Add settings interface so that colors can be set by user.
- Move time out of clock design and into its own proper TextView.
- Adjusted designs' sizes now that we have more space after moving time out of the design.
- Update documentation to reflect new designs.
- Make it possible to change the time manually by touch and drag motions. (in Bally)
- Added background color option.
- Eliminated buttons obsoleted by settings interface.
- Added welcome screen.
- Changed Menu to Toolbar icons.
- "What time is it?" quiz
- Implement custom TimeEntryDialog.
