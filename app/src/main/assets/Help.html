<a name="idea"></a> <h2>The idea</h2>
If an ordinary clock would tell time in the form<p/>
<div align="center">10&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;06&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;47.</div><p/>
then a &ldquo;Chinese Remainder Clock&rdquo; tells this same time in the form<p/>
<div align="center">1&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;.</div><p/>
These digits are the remainders after dividing:
<ul>
    <li style="color:blue;"><span style="color:black;">hours by 3 and 4,</span></li>
    <li style="color:red;"><span style="color:black;">minutes by 3, 4, and 5, and</span></li>
    <li style="color:green;"><span style="color:black;">seconds by 3, 4, and 5.</span></li>
</ul>
A famous result called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Remainder_Theorem"><b>Chinese Remainder Theorem</b></a>
promises that:
<ul>
    <li style="color:blue;"><span style="color:black;">if you know
        the 3-remainder and the 4-remainder for the hour,
        then you can reconstruct the hour;</span></li>
    <li style="color:red;"><span style="color:black;">if you know
        the 3-remainder, the 4-remainder, and the 5-remainder for the minute,
        then you can reconstruct the minute; and</span></li>
    <li style="color:green;"><span style="color:black;">if you know
        the 3-remainder, the 4-remainder, and the 5-remainder for the second,
        then you can reconstruct the second.</span></li>
</ul>
The important thing is that the numbers that we use for division have no common factors.
For example, knowing the 2-remainder and the 6-remainder would not suffice to reconstruct the hour.

<a name="options"></a> <h2>Options</h2>
If you touch the main screen, a toggle will appear that will let you select
<a href="#manual">automatic or manual</a> operation of the clock.

If you select &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; from the menu,
several options will appear:
<ul>
    <li>Design options
    <ul>
        <li>an option to choose the clock&rsquo;s <a href="#design">the artistic design</a>;</li>
        <li>a color clock or a black-and-white clock;</li>
        <li>colors for the clock (appropriate to the choice given); and</li>
        <li>how to order the units when drawing the clock;</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Timekeeping options
    <ul>
        <li>whether to show the as an ordinary clock would;</li>
        <li>whether to show the seconds on the clock; and</li>
        <li>whether to show a 12-hour clock or a <a href="#hours">24-hour clock</a>.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<a name="design"></a><h3>Clock designs</h3>
We can classify the clock designs into two basic kinds:
<ul>
    <li><a href="#circular">Circular</a>
    <ul>
        <li>Archy</li>
        <li>Archy Fade</li>
        <li>Bally</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="#polygonal">Polygonal</a>
    <ul>
        <li>Bubbly</li>
        <li>Linus</li>
        <li>Shady</li>
        <li>Vertie</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<a name="circular"></a><h4>Circular designs</h4>
A traditional, analog clock has hands that point to the correct time.
For the hour, there are 12 positions on the circle, and
for the minute, there are 60 positions.
The hands rotate in &ldquo;clockwise&rdquo; fashion and you can read the time instantly
by simply looking at the hands&rsquo; positions.
<p/>
A circular Chinese Remainder Clock design behaves similarly.
Using one circle for each remainder we consider:
<ul>
    <li style="color:blue;"><span style="color:black;">the hour has
        one circle with three positions and one circle with four positions;
    </span></li>
    <li style="color:red;"><span style="color:black;">
        the minute has one circle with three positions,
        one circle with four positions,
        and one circle with five positions; and
    </span></li>
    <li style="color:green;"><span style="color:black;">
        the second has one circle with three positions,
        one circle with four positions,
        and one circle with five positions.
    </span></li>
</ul>
The position for the zero remainder lies at the top of each circle.
Increasing a remainder by 1 means to rotate the position on the corresponding circle
one step clockwise.
<ul>
    <li>The &ldquo;Archy&rdquo; designs accomplish this
        by highlighting the correct arcs of a circle.</li>
    <li>The &ldquo;Bally&rdquo; design accomplishes this by moving balls to the correct positions.
        It also enjoys a unique feature: in manual mode, you can manipulate the time
        by grabbing and rotating a ball.
    </li>
</ul>

<a name="polygonal"></a><h4>Polygonal designs</h4>
Instead of considering positions on a circle, a digital clock simply lists
the hours, minutes, and seconds.
<p/>
A polygonal Chinese Remainder Clock design behaves similarly,
but instead of writing the remainders as numbers
we represent them by modifying a triangle, square, pentagon, or octagon
to convey whether we mean the 3-, 4-, 5-, or 8-remainder.
<ul>
    <li style="color:blue;"><span style="color:black;">the hour has a triangle
        and a square (or, in the 24-hour clock, an
        octagon);</span></li>
    <li style="color:red;"><span style="color:black;">the minute has a triangle,
        a square, and a pentagon; and</span></li>
    <li style="color:green;"><span style="color:black;">the second has a triangle,
        a square, and a pentagon.</span></li>
</ul>
The polygonal designs included here exhibit a bit of variety in how they use this basic idea.
<ul>
<li>For the &ldquo;Bubbly&rdquo; design, bubbles appear over the polygon: some filled, some not.
The number of filled bubbles tells you the remainder.</li>
<li>For the &ldquo;Linus&rdquo; design, a line winds its way around the polygon, so that
the number of highlighted sides tells you the remainder.</li>
<li>For the &ldquo;Shady&rdquo; design, the polygon&rsquo;s shade tells you the remainder:
the darkest shade is 0, and the brightest shade is the largest value.
As it can be somewhat difficult to make out the shades, the also writes the remainder as a number.</li>
<li>Finally, the &ldquo;Vertie&rdquo; design is similar to &ldquo;Linus&rdquo;, but
instead of a line winding its way around the polygon, a small ball does.</li>
</ul>

<!--<a name="analog"></a><h4>The &ldquo;analog&rdquo; Chinese Remainder Clock</h4>
A traditional clock has hands that point to the correct time.
For the hour, there are 12 positions on the circle, and
for the minute, there are 60 positions.
We do the same thing here, using one circle for each remainder we consider:
<ul>
    <li style="color:blue;"><span style="color:black;">the hour has
        one circle with three positions and one circle with four positions
        (the innermost rings of the dial);
    </span></li>
    <li style="color:red;"><span style="color:black;">
        the minute has one circle with three positions,
        one circle with four positions,
        and one circle with five positions
        (the outermost rings of the dial); and
    </span></li>
    <li style="color:green;"><span style="color:black;">
        the second has one circle with three positions,
        one circle with four positions,
        and one circle with five positions
        (interleaved among the outermost rings of the dial).
    </span></li>
</ul>
The position for the zero remainder lies at the top of each circle.
Increasing a remainder by 1 means to rotate the position on the corresponding circle one step clockwise.

<a name="digital"></a><h4>The &ldquo;digital&rdquo; Chinese Remainder Clock</h4>
Instead of considering positions on a circle, we can simply list the remainders.
We write these numbers in a triangle, square, pentagon, or octagon
to convey whether we mean the 3-, 4-, 5-, or 8-remainder.
<ul>
    <li style="color:blue;"><span style="color:black;">the hour has a triangle
        and a square (or, in the 24-hour clock, an
        octagon), placed on the left;</span></li>
    <li style="color:red;"><span style="color:black;">the minute has a triangle,
        a square, and a pentagon, placed in the middle; and</span></li>
    <li style="color:green;"><span style="color:black;">the second has a triangle,
        a square, and a pentagon, placed on the right.</span></li>
</ul>-->

<a name="manual"></a><h3>Automatic or Manual</h3>
When the &ldquo;Auto&rdquo; toggle is activated,
the clock displays the phone&rsquo;s current time.
Pressing the toggle switches to a &ldquo;Manual&rdquo; mode,
where you can modify the time directly, and experiment with how the clock works.
In this mode,
<ul>
    <li>a &ldquo;drop-down menu&rdquo; lets you indicate whether you wish to modify
        the hour, minute, or second;</li>
    <li>two buttons labeled &ldquo;-1&rdquo; and &ldquo;+1&rdquo; let you decrement or increment
        the selected unit of time; and</li>
    <li>a text box lets you choose a value directly.</li>
</ul>

<a name="hours"></a><h3>12- or 24-hour mode</h3>

Traditionally, time is measured in 12-hour increments,
but many individuals and organizations tell time in 24-hour increments.
The default for the Chinese Remainder Clock is to use 12-hour increments,
but since 24&nbsp;=&nbsp;3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;8, we can divide the hours by 8 instead of by 4.
Pressing the &ldquo;12 hour&rdquo; toggle will change from 12- to 24-hour mode;
pressing that toggle again will change it back.
