TODO
Some clocks (e.g., Ballsy) are 1 second behind. It's probably not noticeable,
but we should consider fixing them.

TODO
For Polly, the following worked on my phone (until I deleted and rewrote it, at least),
but I'm not sure about slower devices, so it's commented out.
If we can make this more efficient, change it so that the alpha increases, like so:
    if (my_offset > 0.96)
        ball_paint.setAlpha(51 * (smod5 % 5 + 1));
    else
        ball_paint.setAlpha(51 * (int) (smod5 % 5 + my_offset));*/

TODO
Split Polly into three different designs:
a) Linus simply moves lines about a polygon.
b) Shady fills a polygon without using lines.
c) Vertie rotates a highlight around the vertices, much as Ballsy rotates a ball around a circle.
