TODO
Some clocks (e.g., Bally) are 1 second behind. It's probably not noticeable,
but we should consider fixing them.

TODO
Quiz mode! with "accomplishments!"

TODO
Add settings interface so that colors can be set by user.

TODO
Implement hiding of seconds representation.

TODO
The settings panel will crash if we reorient the phone while the settings are open.
Android docs have some information on this; fix!

DONE
- Fade in/out of Polly (6ish June 2017).
- First implementation of Archy (6ish June 2017).
- First implementation of Bubbly (13 June 2017).
- Split Polly into three different designs:
  a) Linus simply moves lines about a polygon.
  b) Shady fills a polygon without using lines.
  c) Vertie rotates a highlight around the vertices, much as Ballsy rotates a ball around a circle.
- Move strings to string file(s), to assist with eventual internationalization.
  (This may not be entirely done, but I'm cleaning it up wherever I find it.)
- Add an honest settings panel and clean up the interface.
- Add a toggle to hide the seconds.
- Add a toggle to hide the time.
- Implement toggle to hide the time.
